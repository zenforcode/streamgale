**StreamGale** is a high-performance, distributed real-time stream processing engine written in **C++**. Inspired by **Apache Storm**, it enables developers to process unbounded streams of data with low latency, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Processing** – Processes data streams with ultra-low latency.
- **Scalability** – Distributed architecture with parallel processing.
- **Fault Tolerance** – Ensures continuous processing even in case of node failures.
- **Flexible Topology** – Define custom processing pipelines with **Spouts** (data sources) and **Bolts** (processing nodes).
- **Multi-Language Support** – Extendable to support Python, Java, and more.
- **Lightweight** – Optimized for high throughput with minimal resource usage.

## 🔧 Installation
### Prerequisites
- **C++17 or later**
- **CMake**
- **Boost Libraries** (for networking and threading)
- **ZeroMQ** (for distributed messaging)
