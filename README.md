**StreamGale** is a high-performance, distributed real-time stream processing engine written in **C++** and **Rust**. Inspired by **Apache Storm**, it enables developers to process unbounded streams of data with low latency, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Processing** – Processes data streams with ultra-low latency.
- **Scalability** – Distributed architecture with parallel processing.
- **Fault Tolerance** – Ensures continuous processing even in case of node failures.
- **Flexible Topology** – Define custom processing pipelines with **Spouts** (data sources) and **Bolts** (processing nodes).
- **Machine Learning Support** – Integrate real-time ML models with **ONNX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch**.
- **Multi-Language Support** – Extendable to support Python, Java, and more.
- **Lightweight** – Optimized for high throughput with minimal resource usage.


## 📚 Architecture Overview
### **Core Components**
- **Spout:** Data sources that emit tuples (e.g., from Kafka, files, sensors).
- **Bolt:** Processing units that transform, filter, and aggregate data.
- **Topology:** A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) defining the flow of data.
- **Stream:** The communication channel between spouts and bolts.

## 🛠️ Configuration
Modify the `config.yaml` file to adjust settings:
```yaml
workers: 4
logging_level: INFO
network:
  port: 5555
  protocol: zmq
```

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Distributed Cluster Support
- [ ] Persistent State Management
- [ ] Trident API for Exactly-Once Processing
- [ ] Kubernetes & Docker Integration
- [ ] Python API for User-Friendly Development
- [ ] Advanced ML Pipeline Support (Streaming ML Inference)
