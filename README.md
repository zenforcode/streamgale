## **Why StreamGale?**
🚀 **Purpose-built for AI, Edge Computing, and LLMs** – unlike Kafka/Pulsar/Kinesis, which focus on generic event streaming.  
💰 **Saves 40-60% on cloud compute and storage costs** – by streaming AI data efficiently.  
⚡ **Delivers real-time AI inferences (<10ms latency)** – perfect for **medical imaging, fleet operations, and AI model training**.  
📡 **Optimized for edge AI + hybrid cloud workflows** – ideal for **IoT, industrial AI, and decentralized AI training**.
